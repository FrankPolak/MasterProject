# Integrative Deep Clustering and eXplainable AI for Multi-Omic Breast Cancer Patient Stratification and Prognosis

## Abstract
Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, largely due to its complex molecular heterogeneity, which complicates effective patient stratification and treatment. This study applies a deep learning framework to integrate RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data to identify molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Analysis of 511 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed two distinct clusters showing biologically meaningful differences in gene expression, including markers associated with aggressive tumour behaviour. Explainability analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation contributed disproportionately to patient separation, emphasising the role of epigenetic alterations in breast cancer heterogeneity. However, statistical testing showed no significant associations between clusters and clinical variables or overall survival, indicating that further refinement is required to enhance clinical relevance. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for multi-omic integration and the importance of interpretable models in uncovering biologically distinct cancer subgroups.
